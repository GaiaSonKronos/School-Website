<p><h4>PRE PRIMARY</h4><br> 
<font face="Microsoft Himalaya" size="05" color="grey">Activity appeals to the childs innate tendencies. At the pre primary level we provide theme based activities that is learning-related. To stimulate learning we have a special play area which is a well equipped room where students are led to discover the world around them based on the themes through fantasy or imaginative play. Multimedia and audio visual aid further facilitates their learning and the fivefold development i.e. Physical development, Social development, Emotional development, Mental development and Spiritual development.</font></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><h4>PRIMARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL</h4><br>
<font face="Microsoft Himalaya" size="05" color="grey">The Primary school recognises the link between development and learning. Inquiry based curriculum focuses on the child as a learner. To make students self-reliant and independent individuals learning takes place through project method and cooperative learning. To discourage rote learning teachers lead the students through various study skills. Language Activities (LAC), Mathematic activities (MAC), Science Activity Rooms, Exploration Lab provide the students an opportunity to explore and discover. Assignments, quizzes, competitions, debates, elocution, group discussions, club activities, experiments, research, etc. are the various techniques used to necessitate holistic development of the child. Here, the learning objectives are successfully combined with our philosophy of focusing on our students and their learning needs. We are uniquely open to flexibility of our courses and upgrade with all changes in the field of education.</font></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><h4>SECONDARY SCHOOL</h4><br>
<font face="Microsoft Himalaya" size="05" color="grey">We have regularly instituted reforms in evaluation patterns and examination. The prime focus of our curriculum is to innovate teaching-learning methodologies by developing paradigms that are conducive for students. We therefore emphasise on:<br>
Easy and stress free assessment tools that value our students' creativity and help teachers assess their cognitive skills.<br>
Integrating skill learning by adding life skill oriented, value based inputs in our curriculum.<br>
The delivery of lessons from the primary level to the secondary level is based on:<br>
(i) Integrated Curriculum<br>
(ii) Interdisciplinary Approach<br>
(iii) Experiential Learning<br>
(iv) Research Work and<br>
(v) Professional Talk<br>
<br><br></font>
<p><h4>SENIOR SCHOOL</h4><br>
<font face="Microsoft Himalaya" size="05" color="grey">The senior school boasts of an enthusiastic group of teachers, eager to experiment, research, learn and re-learn. Reaching the zenith being their aim and equipped with the state of art laboratories, in the subjects of science, mathematics and social science, a richly compiled library and smart rooms to bring their thoughts to realization, taking understanding of a concept to a different level, they nurture their students to believe in their own best selves. Regular trips and excursions, as lesson extensions, help them reinforce their concepts better.The teachers, experts in their respective fields, and with passion of art and literature, aim towards fulfilling their dream of building future citizens with strong logical minds and a holistic approach, individuals competent to take up all responsibilities with a smile.<br><br>

Our students gradually encouraged to explore the relationship between practical and theoretical concepts of various subjects, thus learning to analyse how the topic extends beyond the classroom and into the outside world. The boundaries of subjects are dissolved and students learn across the curriculum. Subjects are not taught in isolation as in the conservative methods thus cultivating higher order thinking abilities, encouraging our young minds to focus on their critical thinking and problem solving skills.<br><br>

We have developed upon Language enhancement classes by an expert, regular practice work, result analysis at all levels of evaluation and remediation to address all academic needs.</font>
